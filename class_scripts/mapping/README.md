# Data Download Scripts
This folder contains the scripts to download additional datasets for forecasting.  Please upload the portion of your script that downloads additional datasets and formats them into a pandas dataframe to this folder. 

- Your script should be named `lastname_data.py`
- Your script should be well commented, follow pep8 standards and be easy to follow.
- **Do not** upload the datasets to the repo. Its okay if your script wont run from the forecast repo because its pointing to files you have locally.
- This script should include only what is necessary to download your datasets and format into a usable dataframe or numpy array. Don't include your forecast analysis here.
